# TheSmallBusinessTheme.OrchardCore
Theme for Orchard Core based on the Modern Business theme of Start Bootstrap

See the [README](https://github.com/psijkof/TheSmallBusinessTheme.OrchardCore/blob/master/wwwroot/README.md) file of the embedded theme repo.

The goal is to implement this template as efficiently as possible with [Orchard Core](https://github.com/OrchardCMS/OrchardCore)

  "query": {
